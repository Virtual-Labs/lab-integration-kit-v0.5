* Checkpoints

+ Introduction to virtualization
+ Openvz running
+ Container creation

The documentation of openVZ can be found at:

* What is Virtualization?

+ Method of dividing computer resources
+ Multiple isolated environments
+ Types
+ Emulation
+ Paravirtualization
+ OS level virtualization


* Operating System level virtualization

+ Multiple isolated execution environments within a single OS kernel
+ Doesnot allow to run different kernels from different OSs at the same time
+ Best possible performance
+ Examples: OpenVZ, Linux-VServer

* Virtual Environment / Container

+ Look and feel of separate physical server
+ VE has its own
+ Process tree with init
+ File system
+ Network interfaces with IP addresses, Firewall rules, Routing tables
+ Multiple VEs co-exist within a single physical server.
+ Different VEs can run different Linux distros
+ But, all VEs operate under same kernel

* OpenVZ kernel

Modified Linux based kernel which comes with following functionalities
+ Virtualization and Isolation
+ Enables many VEs within a single kernel
+ Resource management: Manages CPU, RAM, Disk space per VE basis
+ Checkpointing: Freezing a VE, Saving its state to disk with ability to unfreeze that state later

* OpenVZ vs VMware/virtualbox

+ Virtualbox - Hardware assisted
+ OpenVZ - OS level virtualization

* Demo on OpenVZ

+ Vzctl
+ create 
+ start
+ set
+ reset
+ status
+ enter
+ stop
+ Vzlist
